      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        I selected 3 music streaming websites, and compared their favorite (playlist) feature:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify</a>
          <hr>
          <img src="assets/4/spotify.png" alt="">
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/home?l=en-US">Apple Music</a>
          <hr>
          <img src="assets/4/apple.png" alt="">
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://music.amazon.com/my/playlists">Amazon Music</a>
          <hr>
          <img src="assets/4/amazon.png" alt="">
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please note that this chart only compares the web version of the apps only. Some features are available on apps, but we do not count them in.</p>

      <h3>Analysis for Each Service</h3>

      <p class="bigger-text">
        Spotify:
      </p>
      <div class="row-li">
          <img src="assets/4/spotify-playlist.png" style="width: 300px" alt="">
          <img src="assets/4/spotify-add-to-lists.png" style="width: 200px" alt="">
      </div>
      <hr>
      <p>Most successful point: Spotify implemented rich features that other streaming service does not have. The playlists can be sorted in multiple orders and viewed in multiple visual modes, and it's very easy for users to utilize - just click the button in the top right corner of library, then select the action, and it's done. It's also possible to add a song to multiple playlists at one time. Those features greatly increases the usability of the website.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Least successful point: Playlists cannot be directly shared on social media like Facebook and Twitter, which makes it harder for users to share their taste in music.</p>

      <p class="bigger-text">
        Apple Music:
      </p>
      <div class="row-li">
        <img src="assets/4/apple-menu.png" style="width: 500px" alt="">
      </div>
      <hr>
      <p>Most successful point: Use of icons is everywhere for every feature that is implemented for playlist, which is good for learnability and usability. For example, in the menu above for a playlist, there's one icon for almost each choice in the menu, making it easier for users to learn what each choice is about and distinguish between similar choices (Play Next vs Play Later).</p>
      <hr>
      <div class="row-li">
        <img src="assets/4/apple-playlists.png" style="width: 200px" alt="">
      </div>
      <hr>
      <p>Least successful point: The least successful point is related to filter and sorting. Playlists cannot be filtered or sorted by users, showing low operability of the website. Playlists can only be sorted in default order by name, but result is wrong when names containing multiple languages. For example, in the above screenshot, last playlist is named "Tamayura" in Japanese but sorted to the last. This shows its disadvantages in terms of accessibility for multiple languages.</p>

      <p class="bigger-text">
        Amazon Music:
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>Most successful point: They are the only website out of all 3 websites that can recommend songs based on your playlist. This allows more detailed personalized recommendation based on different playlist instead of based on songs listened by a user generally.</p>
      <hr>
      <div class="row-li">
        <img src="assets/4/amazon.png" style="width: 800px" alt="">
      </div>
      <hr>
      <p>Least successful point: The website is visually monotonous and lacks attractiveness. All playlists are laid out in grids, with their cover being one or some of the covers of the songs in playlist. With few playlists created, the right part of the screen is completely empty below the header.</p>

      <h3>Inspiration for My Project</h3>
      <p>Based on the analysis above, I have a list of features that I want to implement for my project:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          TODO
        </li>
      </ul>
