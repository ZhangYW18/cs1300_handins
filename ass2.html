      <h2>Task</h2>
      <p>
        Choose an existing webpage, analyze its problems in terms of usability and accessibility, redesign the webpage and implement the redesign in HTML and CSS.
      </p>

      <h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
      <p>I chose the <a href="https://primarywalkinmedical.com/">Home Page of Primary Walkin Medical Center</a>. The webpage is the home page of a local urgent care center.</p>
        <p>Link: <a href="https://primarywalkinmedical.com/">https://primarywalkinmedical.com/</a></p>
        <p>I chose this webpage because it has lots of potential to improve, due to the usability and accessibility problems it has. The problems are explained further in following parts.</p>
        <p>Below is the screenshot of the webpage. The black header will stay on the top of screen no matter how we scroll down the webpage, so in the full-size screenshot below, it's near the bottom.</p>

        <h3>Usability Problems</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Efficiency: The address and the map are seperated on the web page. For people who are looking for the location of the medical center, it takes more time for them to scroll down to find the map.
          </li>
          <li>
            Efficiency: The hours of medical center and laser skincare are one type of information and can be merged into one component. Currently, they are seperate and cost users more time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attractiveness: The left bottom half of the web page is largely blank, causing a sense of asymmetry for users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Learnability: All page links available for the website is listed in "Pages" section in right bottom corner of this page. Usually, the links are put in footer for reference. Location of this section makes it difficult for users to get used to. Also, with the headers in the top of webpage, the "Pages" section provides repetitive information and is not very important. It's better to put this in footer area of the webpage instead of put it in main body of the webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Memorability, Learnability: Lack of icons in the contact section makes users difficult to remember different types of contact information. Users need to read all the text to find the information they want.
          </li>
          <li>
            Understandability: The names of links in "Pages" section are confusing. For example, it makes no sense why "Primary laser skincare" and "Primary laser skincare pricing" are two separate links. "Primary laser skincare pricing" could be merged into "Primary laser skincare". Also, name of "Forms" link has only one word and does not provide more information about the forms. It can be removed as well, since it's already in the header.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Accessibility Problems</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Some picture lack alt texts.</li>
          <li>The grey text is difficult to see with white background behind. </li>
          <li>Most text are made of capital letters, making it difficult to read.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All those problems make the web page poorly accessible for both manual users and users with disability.

          <h3>Sketches</h3>

          <h4>Speed sketches</h4>
          <p>
            Based on the analysis above and my intuition, I drew 9 speed sketches for the redesign of the website. Each of them takes me very little time, and is only a rough idea during the process of brainstorming.
          </p>
          <div class="image-div">
            <img class="sketch" src="./assets/handin/sketch1.jpg" alt="speed sketch - crazy 9 redesigns">
          </div>

          <h4>Final Sketch</h4>
          <p>
            After brainstorming, it's time to integrate what I thought about together to get an overall framework of my redesign. In each of my speed sketches, there're good things, but there're bad things as well. The final sketch give me a chance to gather the advantages of each sketch.

          <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
          <h6><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/nUw2ulbdktKFMLa9DRyxPh/Primary-Walk-in-Clinic---LoFi?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=Za8EHSa1L5LAJWlC-1">Link on Figma</a></h6>
          <p>
            In final sketch, I already got an overall idea of what my redesigned webpage would look like, but the sketch is somewhat messy. Also, it didn't adapt to different screen sizes as well. A more standardized way of showing the framework of web pages is to draw wireframes in a software called Figma.
          </p>
          <p>
            I drew 3 low-fidelity wireframes firstly: each for desktop, tablet, mobile screen size. They only show the framework of the web page and does not contain many details like color and text. I also added annotations on the wireframes to explain how the redesign solves usability issues and accessibility issues we listed above (mainly in desktop-size wireframe), and how the web page can adapt to different screen size (mainly in tablet-size and mobile-size wireframe).
          </p>
          <div>
            <h4>Desktop Screen</h4>
            <div class="image-div">
              <img class="desktop" src="./assets/handin/lofi/lofi-desktop.jpg" alt="Low-Fidelity Wireframe - Desktop Screen">
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Tablet Screen</h4>
            <div class="image-div">
              <img class="tablet" src="./assets/handin/lofi/lofi-tablet.jpg" alt="Low-Fidelity Wireframe - Tablet Screen">
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Mobile Screen</h4>
            <div class="image-div">
              <img class="mobile-lofi" src="./assets/handin/lofi/lofi-mobile.jpg" alt="Low-Fidelity Wireframe - Mobile Screen">

          <h3>Style Guide</h3>
          <h6><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/ne1VWYiCxl5PMYBSfEug1z/Primary-Walk-in-Clinic?type=design&node-id=66%3A30&mode=design&t=3kzSOkiTBJwTvx8V-1">Link on Figma</a></h6>
          <p>
            After drawing low-fidelity wireframes, we can add more details to the wireframes to turn them into high-fidelity mockups. Before that, we need to draw the style guide, in which we specify the font, color, and reusable components of the web page. The visual guide reduces the time we spent on drawing high-fidelity mockups. It's also meaningful for team cooperation and developments in late stage.
          </p>
          <div class="image-div">

          <h3>High-Fidelity Mockup</h3>
          <h6><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/ne1VWYiCxl5PMYBSfEug1z/Primary-Walk-in-Clinic?type=design&node-id=1%3A3&mode=design&t=3kzSOkiTBJwTvx8V-1">Link on Figma</a></h6>
          <p>
            With the style guide, we could draw high-fidelity mockups for each screen size based on it. The mockups look just like what our users will see after web pages are delivered. It includes all the details of a web page.
          </p>

          The last step is to implement the web page using html and css according to the high-fidelity mockups. Here's the links to my final work:

      <h2>A Surprising Finding</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          During the assignment, I was surprised that most websites didn't take accessibility into account, especially those of small businesses. I analyzed some websites in Part 1 of the assignment, and many of them reflected errors through checks of WebAIM.
